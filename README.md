# HTML5 Vibrate API Exploit
We've all seen those scummy adverts designed to look like Windows pop-ups. They usually pose as a legitimate system request - "Update Java" or similar.

Suppose a malicious web page pops up a fake system notification and vibrates at the same time. How confident would you be of telling the difference between a legitimate pop-up and a .png on the web page you're viewing. After all, the phone buzzed - so it must be genuine.

This is a proof of concept with minimal html interface...

### Exploit
You can use HTML5 Vibrate API for creating realisting phishing pages. At the moment, accessing the HTML5 Vibrate API doesn't trigger an on-screen warning.
